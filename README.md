## Vanity Number Converter Project

This project demonstrates the creation of an AWS Lambda function that converts phone numbers to vanity numbers, saves the results to a DynamoDB table, and integrates with an Amazon Connect contact flow. The solution also includes optional tasks for deployment using AWS tools and a web app to display recent vanity numbers.
